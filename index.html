        <h2>Brain in a Fishtank</h2>
        <h4><i>Artist: Shpongle</i></h4>

        <p>This is a story about<br>
        A museum of consciousness</p>
        <p>Release to you<br>
            The sins I've made<br>
            The danse macabre can now begin<br>
            Stone wall floating through the sand<br>
            Protective circles all around</p>
        <p>Break apart to build anew<br>
        Golden prisms rage on through<br>
        Holographic pyramids<br>
        Were seen behind closed eyelids</p>
        <p>It feels like my brain<br>
        Was floating in a fishtank</p>
        <p>I've never felt like that ever before</p>
